My name is Patrick Galvin. I'm a 13 year old web and mobile developer. I've been programming for several years now, and in that time I've created a number of projects. This blog is all about my projects and experiences as a programmer.

I know the following languages well:

* Ruby & Rails
* Python
* C++
* JavaScript
* Delphi
* Swift

And of course I know HTML5 and CSS3 too, but they're markdown languages.
